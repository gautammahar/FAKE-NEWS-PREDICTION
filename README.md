# FAKE-NEWS-PREDICTION
This is a machine learning project that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as "real" or "fake". The project is designed to help users identify misinformation and disinformation, which have become increasingly prevalent in today's information landscape.

The project is built using Python and various open-source libraries for data processing and machine learning, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. The dataset used for training and testing the models is a publicly available corpus of news articles labeled as "real" or "fake".

The project includes several components, including:
Data preprocessing: This involves cleaning and transforming the raw text data into a format that can be used for machine learning, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction.
Model training: The project includes several machine learning models for news classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The models are trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess their accuracy.
Model selection: The project includes a comparison of different machine learning models to determine the best-performing one for news classification.
Model deployment: The final trained model is deployed as a web application that allows users to input news articles and receive a prediction of whether the article is real or fake.

The project is available on Github and includes detailed documentation on how to use the code, how to reproduce the results, and how to deploy the model as a web application. Feel free to contribute to the project and help improve the accuracy of the news authenticity checker!
